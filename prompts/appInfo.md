MacBoary is a lightweight, secure clipboard manager designed for macOS. It aims to provide the "missing equivalent" to the Windows Clipboard History (Win+V) feature for Mac users. It sits in the menu bar, tracks copied text and images, and allows users to easily paste past items. It focuses on privacy (local storage), security (encryption), and a native macOS feel.
